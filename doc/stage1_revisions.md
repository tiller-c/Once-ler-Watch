The following paragraph was added for the missing creative component section:

Our creative component will be an interactive map, allowing users to click on any location on the map, giving them the deforestation information around that area. Users will also be able to drag a slider below the map to increase or decrease the radius around that location. If the user does not want to use the interactive map to click on a location, the map will display through a color metric the deforestation level of every country. Our app will allow the user to query the most recently searched locations as well as locations with the highest total views. We will implement this by creating an empty dataset to track the recent searches that users can view. When someone views a location, it updates the view count/recency. It will only show the ten most recent searches, and our application will delete old searches from this dataset.
